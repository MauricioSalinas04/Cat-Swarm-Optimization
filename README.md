# Cat-Swarm-Optimization
This project implements the Cat Swarm Optimization (CSO) heuristic in Python, an algorithm inspired by feline behavior to solve optimization problems. The CSO heuristic divides cats into two main modes: Seeking Mode and Tracing Mode, alternating between exploration and exploitation to search for optimal solutions in the search space.
